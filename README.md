# SAR Component Advisor

## Description
SAR Component Advisor is a Blender add-on designed to simplify the decision-making process in the installation of Projector-based Spatial Augmented Reality (SAR) systems. This tool assists users in selecting appropriate components for SAR systems based on project requirements, reducing the need for extensive technical expertise and time investment.

Key features:
- Generates valid proposals for SAR systems considering project requirements
- Allows users with reduced technical knowledge to select SAR system components
- Reduces time required for SAR system decision making
- Provides a 3D model of the platform setup
- Offers a comprehensive list of components with technical specifications

## Installation

1. Download the latest release of the SAR Component Advisor add-on from this repository.
2. Open Blender and go to Edit > Preferences > Add-ons.
3. Click on "Install" and navigate to the downloaded add-on file.
